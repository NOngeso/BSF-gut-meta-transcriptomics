How about we try use bioinformatics to make economically feasible and more efficient the production of second generation (cellulosic biofuels)?

Cellulosic and lignocellulosic (second-generation) biofuel production has emerged as a sustainable and alternative energy option to the fast depleting, ecologically unfriendly petroleum-based fuels. Second-generation biofuels are produced from energy crops such as switchgrass, industrial and agricultural wastes, and crop residues, and therefore, are not a threat to food security.â€¯ 
The Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) is a useful tool in the valorization of organic biomass and other biodegradable wastes. We intend to use the microbes present in the Black soldier Fly (BSF) larvae gut to explore their broad degradation capabilities under different diets so that we can be able to apply this knowledge to break down the lignin component as well as the complex sugars (cellulose and hemicellulose) that are present in second-generation biofuel feedstocks. Additionally, metatranscriptomics analysis from RNA-sequencing derived data will enable us to profile the microorganisms present in the BSF larval gut up to strain level as well as their functions in the gut. Analysis of their differentially expressed genes and the metabolic pathways involved will enable us to acquire a deeper understanding of the degradative enzymes which could be further applied in the hydrolysis of these complex sugars as well as other industrial applications. This could significantly lower the costs of second-generation biofuel production, increase the biofuel production efficiency, and lessen the imminent threat on food security.
