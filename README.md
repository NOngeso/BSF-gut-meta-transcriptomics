# BSF-gut-meta-transcriptomics
To provide additional validation of the metatranscriptomic sequences, the 16S rRNA reads filtered out during the ribodepletion step were used to perform taxonomic profiling. 
The filtered out 16S rRNA sequences are analyzed using this custom vSearch-Usearch pipeline to compute diversity statistics, and subset the most abundant taxonomic groups to establish differences between metatranscriptomics and 16S rRNA taxonomic profiling.
